Computer Networks

Description:

Course provides an introduction to concepts and issues involved in computer networks and data
communications. Topics include the Internet, protocol layers and their service models (with a focus on the TCP/IP
model), network programming, principles of reliable data transfer, congestion control, routing, error detection and
correction techniques, analog and digital data signaling and transmission, and a variety of other topics in network
security, multimedia networking, mobile and wireless data communications, and network management.

Topics:

-- Networking fundamentals.-- A history of computer networking and the Internet; the structure of the Internet;
connectionless and connection-oriented services; circuit switching and packet switching fundamentals;
protocols; layered protocol architectures and service models.

-- Protocol layers.-- The OSI and TCP/IP layered architectures; the application layer and sample
application services; transport layer services, including discussions of the principles of reliable data transfer
and congestion control; network layer services, including routing and multicasting; data link layer services,
including error detection and correction techniques and a variety of protocols (Ethernet, wireless 802.11X,
etc.); physical layer services, including signalling, analog and digital data transmission, and channel capacity.

-- Network programming.-- Socket programming; TCP and UDP programming interfaces; asynchronous
communications; advanced socket options and programming techniques.

-- Advanced topics.-- Multimedia networking; network security; wireless and mobile computing; network
management.
